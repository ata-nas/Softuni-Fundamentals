# Softuni-Fundamentals
This is a repo for Softuni Fundamentals with Python course.

This repo will mainly be used as a tutorial for me to learn Git and to upload homeworks and projects from the Softuni course.

The repo consists of single file solutions of the exercises in the Soft Uni Programming Fundamentals with Python course.

No best practices are used and I try to solve the problems with the least amount of builtin functions and additional modules in order for me to better understand the logic and reasoning of how to approach and solve the problems at hand.
